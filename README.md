## Bachelors Research Project -  `Rescaled Range Analysis of Normal and Abnormal Heart Sound Signals.`

## About
Code and database for estimating the Rescaled Range and Hurst exponent values for Normal and Abnormal Heart Sound Signals. This project was done as my undergraduate reseach project (BSc. Mechanical Engineering, University of Ibadan)

This project was inspired by the Physionet 2016 Computing in Cardiology challenge, which was aimed at accurately classifying Heart Signals from Phonocardiograms (PCG) as Normal/Abnormal for Low-to-Middle-Income-Countries.

The results of this study were published in the `Journal of Engineering Research and Reports`. You can read the full paper <a href = "https://doi.org/10.9734/jerr/2019/v7i316971"> here </a>
